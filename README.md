# Vitis HLS dot product
This repository automates IP building for Vitis HLS dot product accelerator and provides bare-metal application code.
It is all arranged to be UninaSoC directories-compliant.

You can clone all git repository or use only fetch_sources.sh.
- If you clone all repo, outputs will be in hw/build/ directory;
- If you use fetch_sources.sh only, outputs will be in build/ directory.

## Algorithm description


## Hardware build
To compile HLS and package the IP:

    make syn
    make package

from hw/ directory.

Or you can call

    ./scripts/fetch_sources.sh

To extract only rtl sources (in Verilog), ip directory for Vivado and ip zip.
Outputs will be located in build/ directory.

## Application build
The bare-metal application is already arranged to be UninaSoC directories-compliant.
You can test if it compiles by using Makefile (you need riscv bare-metal toolchain).

After importing on UninaSoC some files must be deleted:
* startup/ dir 
* Makefile_test is not needed for UninaSoC

To test compilation:

    make -f Makefile_test
